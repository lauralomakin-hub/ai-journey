# ðŸ“… Weekly Plan â€“ Week 38

## To Do
- [ ] Exercise01 â€“ if-statements
- [ ] Exercise02 â€“ while (at least 2 tasks)
- [ ] Exercise03 â€“ for-loops
- [ ] Lab 2 â€“ create code skeleton and TODO list

## In Progress
- [ ] Exercise02 â€“ while

## Done
- [x] Repo cloned and structure created


## Plan for Lab 2 (Week 39)

### Monday (Sep 22)
- [x] Locate the course repo in VS Code  
- [x] Create `labs/lab2/` folder with `README.md` + empty `lab2.ipynb`  
- [x] Make first commit: *"Init lab2 structure"*  

### Tuesday (Sep 23)
- [x] Implement **basic task**  
  - Write function to calculate distance between points  
  - Classify a new point based on the nearest neighbor  
  - Test with the given points (should match the key)  
- [x] Commit: *"Added nearest neighbor classification"*  

### Wednesday (Sep 24)
- [x] Implement **Task 1**  
  - User input for test point  
  - Error handling for negative or non-numeric values  
  - Friendly error messages  
- [ ] Commit: *"User input with error handling"*  

### Thursday (Sep 25)
- [x] Implement **Task 2 (k-NN with k=10)**  
  - Find the 10 nearest neighbors  
  - Majority voting for classification  
- [ ] Test with different inputs  
- [ ] Commit: *"Implemented k-NN with k=10"*  

### Friday (Sep 26)
- [x] Add comments in code, clean up variable names  
- [x] Ensure multiple commits (show progression)  
- [ ] If time/energy â†’ Bonus tasks (train/test split + accuracy)  
- [x] Push everything to GitHub before **23:59**  
- [ ] Commit: *"Final version lab2"*  

## Reflection
## Reflection
- What I learned: the basic Git flow (add â†’ commit â†’ push), and the difference between Markdown edit/preview.
  scatterplot, k_NN.  
- What was challenging: balancing family responsibilities, kids' study time, and finding enough time for my own   exercises.  
- What I want to improve: build routines for shorter, more regular coding sessions, practice explaining my code in  words, and gradually reduce my dependency on AI support for coding.



# Weekly Plan â€“ Week [40] (Labb 3 focus)

## Review goals
- Revisit course lectures and prep course materials
- Go through my own Lab 2 code to ensure I understand the flow
- Start Lab 3: Linear classification

## Tasks by day
**Monday**
- [ ] Read and load `unlabelled_data.csv`
- [ ] Plot points to visualize data

**Tuesday**
- [ ] Understand the line equation `y = kx + m`
- [ ] Implement basic version in code

**Wednesday**
- [ ] Write function to check if a point is above or below the line

**Thursday**
- [ ] Save classified points into `labelled_data.csv`

**Friday**
- [ ] Plot graph with points colored by class
- [ ] Draw the separating line in the graph

**Saturday (VG part / stretch)**
- [ ] Try different line equations
- [ ] Compare results and add short reflection in a Jupyter notebook

## Personal focus
- [ ] Shorter study sessions (2 Ã— 45 min instead of long blocks)
- [ ] Create small side examples to practice functions and structures
- [ ] Add a reflection in `weekly.md` at the end of the week
