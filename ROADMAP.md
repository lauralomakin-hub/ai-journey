This is my public portfolio for my two-year education in AI & Machine Learning at IT-Högskolan in Gothenburg.

Content:
- Overall roadmap for the education

- Weekly plans (`weekly.md`)
- Finished projects (`projects/`)

## Education structure (400 YH credits)

- Introduction to AI (5p)
- Python Programming (40p)
- Data Processing (25p)
- Linear Algebra (20p)
- Statistical Methods (30p)
- Machine Learning (45p)
- Databases (25p)
- Data Engineering & Agile Methods (45p)
- Internship (LIA 1) (40p)
- Deep Learning (40p)
- Internship (LIA 2) (70p)

## Master plan
- [ ] Build a GitHub portfolio (6–8 projects, one per main course area)

- [ ] Publish short reflections on LinkedIn (goal: 1–2 per month)
- [ ] Choose internships (LIA 1 & LIA 2) strategically
- [ ] Final thesis: prototype for the "NPF companion" (AI support tool for children/teens with neurodivergence)
